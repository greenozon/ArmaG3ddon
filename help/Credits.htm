<P>This tool is the culmination of many people's efforts. Were it not
for people's contributions to the RCE community at large, this tool would
not be possible. Whether you wrote a Tutorial, contributed and shared
knowledge in RCE forums, produced a tool or small snippet of code to perform
some unique function, your contributions help further the general knowledge base
and make the process of reverse code engineering easier to learn, understand and
implement.</P>
