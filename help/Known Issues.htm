<P><STRONG>Known Issues</STRONG></P>
<P>You are encouraged to use tools like Armadillo Key Tool, ArmaDetach, ArmadilloFindProtected or ProtectionID to
determine version / features / protection options of a target application.
Should the Import Reconstructor fail, i.e. return code &gt; 0, a workaround is
(Rerun the program, when the program asks you to dump / save, press "Cancel") to
perform the dump and IAT rebuild yourself using a 3rd party tool (LordPE or
similar), CHImpRec, ImpREC (or Magic_h2001's Universal Import fixer - UIF, etc.)
to dump and/or rebuild the imports.<BR>Should the application appear to hang (do
nothing) it could be that the process is taking some time to unpack, a resource
conflict, a compatibility issue with your OS, your AV program or game manager
running in the background, or the version of Armadillo is not supported! In
some cases, if you try again, it may work due to available resources
(memory).<BR>
Note: Make sure there are
no other instances of the target program running in
Windows Task manager before proceeding.</P>
<P><STRONG>Armadillo V6.0+ (Custom Builds)</STRONG></P>
<P>You may need to patch for the condition "Armadillo not protected"
MessageBox before executing a newly dumped file. This messagebox is generated
when the variable <STRONG>ALTUSERNAME</STRONG> is not found when executing
the GetEnvironmentVariableA API. This is quite normal after dumping an
application.</P>
<P>As with any custom build, it is always a good idea to
use the SetEnvironmentVariableA API for all relevant Armadillo
variables in your dumped file prior to executing from the OEP (i.e. build / run
from an existing code cave and return to OEP).</P></BODY></HTML>
