<P>There are (3) choices for processing nanomites.</P>
<P>The radio buttons for analyzing and logging nanomites are mutually exclusive (i.e. you can only select one at
any time). Each option has its strengths and weaknesses.</P>
<P>1. Use the built-in Armadillo Nanomites Fixer v1.2 (public release) dll.<BR>
You are automatically prompted to save any
analysis to an *.anf file for subsequent
patching / viewing.<BR>See also special tool Armadillo Nanomites Fixer v1.2
(public release) in this distribution and notes on usage!<BR>Use of this
feature is fairly straightforward and similar to the standalone version. Simply
select the option. If you have already created a dump file, simply ignore
the "Ready to Dump" messagebox and press "Cancel" to continue analyzing and
processing nanomites.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="analyzenanofixer.jpg"></P>
<P>Error messages for the NanoFixer:</P>
<FONT color=#800000 size=2>
<P>No Real nanomites found, Unknown Error.<BR>
No 0xCC Opcode Found, No INT3 Breakpoint Found.<BR>
Cannot open The File, File Header Is Corrupted.<BR>
Cannot Open Process.<BR>
VirtualAlloc Failed.<BR>
The Loaded .anf File Is Mismatched.</FONT></P>
<P>Note: If after 30 seconds there is little or
no activity found, you will be prompted with a
messagebox:</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="nanofixer_prob.jpg"></P>
<P>Press "OK" to continue processing. Maybe the nanomites are
contained within some function(s) which haven't been processed. Press "Cancel"
to abort the analyzing function with the following messages displayed:</P>
<P><FONT color=#800000 size=2>
Less than 5% and/or no activity for 30 seconds<BR>
Check for multiple instances, anti virus running.<BR>
Analyze nanomites aborted, please try again later...</FONT></P>
<P>2. Analyze all the nanomites in a static (target)
dump. After dumping and rebuilding the target, this option disassembles all
the instructions in the 1st text section logging all possible nanomites to be considered for analyzing.
If you have already created a dump file, simply ignore the "Ready to
Dump" messagebox and press "Cancel" to continue analyzing and processing
nanomites. It may be necessary to run this option 2 or more times because as nanomites
are analyzed and resolved, this could in turn, due to the deobfuscation of
code, reveal new nanomites. When done, you are automatically prompted to save
the analysis to an *.anf file. At this point, you can resolve "Patch Dump"
the dump or load the saved *.anf files later for patching your target
dump or memory process.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="analyzestatic.jpg"></P>
<P>3. Log nanomites dynamically from a running process. For
difficult targets, this may be your best first option. A separate instance
of the target is launched. As nanomites are hit, they are logged to
a table. The table stores uniquely sorted nanomites. This feature may be useful
when the other 2 options fail to detect all the "Real" nanomites. When you
have completed logging (i.e. you have exited the application) the program will
automatically analyze every nanomite from the log table producing an analyzed
file to be saved and/or used for patching a dump or process.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="analyzelog.jpg"></P>
<P>Once a nanomites file is saved, it can be
loaded via the "Load *.anf" button at any time before "Patch Dump" is
required.</P>
<P>The Viewer button will allow for reviewing all processed
"Analyzed" *.anf nanomites for viewing.</P>
<P>Note: The format of the *.anf file is not the same as the previous
*.nan format. Therefore, the external nanomite viewer in the previous release is
not compatible.</P></BODY></HTML>
