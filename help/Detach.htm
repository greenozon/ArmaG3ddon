<P><STRONG>Detach (debug blocker + copymemII only)</STRONG></P>
<P>You can elect to detach from the running child process by selecting the radio
button for the type of detach (DebugBlocker vs CopyMemII). They are mutually
exclusive.<BR><BR>You have 2 choices:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Debug Blocker
  <LI>CopyMemII</UL>
<P align=center><IMG src="detach.jpg"></P>
<P>AFTER Armageddon issues the detach message, DO NOT CLOSE ARMAGEDDON when
detaching! Make sure no other instances of the target process are running prior
to invoking Armageddon.<BR>You may have to manually kill any "Active" target
processes after using this option!!<BR>You can elect to resolve nanomites prior to detaching
(copymemII only). Very Useful!! You will be prompted to do so and you must have previously saved an *.anf
file to Resolve nanomites in memory.<BR>A messagebox will appear asking to "resolve nanomites to
continue?"</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="resolvenanomites.jpg"></P>
<P>Press OK to resolve or Cancel to
bypass this feature.<BR>Nanomites will be resolved (patched) directly to the
target process's memory.<BR><BR>Debug Blocker
occurs right after the child process is launched by the parent process. This is
the Entry Point of the child process. Armageddon will detach the child process
dynamically using the DebugProcessStop API.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="detachdblog.jpg"></P>
<P>As you can see above, you are given the Entry Point for debug blocker, (OEP
for copymemII), the original bytes that must be restored after attaching, and
the process id of the child to attach to.</P>
<P>A context menu has been added for the log window. You can optionally select
one line of text (in the example above, we could have selected the original
bytes, copied them to the clipboard and pasted them into our debugger after
attaching). You can select all list box items, clear all listbox items, select,
clear and/or copy selected items.</P>
<P align=center><IMG src="contextmenu.jpg"></P>
<P>CopyMemII would normally be selected if the code (.text) section of the child
process is encrypted. In addition to handling any Import Elimination and
redirection, code splicing, etc. Armageddon would decrypt all code pages (4096
bytes at a time) of the code section and then detach the child process using the
DebugActiveProcessStop API. You can also choose to use CopyMemII if you simply
want to detach at the OEP of the child process.</P>
<P>Once detached you can use a <STRONG>new instance</STRONG> of an external
debugger (i.e. Ollydbg) to attach to the child process. Armageddon provides the
child processid to attach to and the original bytes that need to be patched
back.</P>
<P>*Note: Some targets may be difficult to detach from /
attach to.</P></BODY></HTML>
