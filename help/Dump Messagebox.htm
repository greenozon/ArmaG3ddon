<P>When the target process has reached the assumed
OEP of the original application, a messagebox appears prompting you to save "OK"
or "Cancel" the operation. If you don't wish to dump the target process (i.e. you
are detaching, analyzing or logging nanomites) or have already dumped the
file, press "Cancel".</P>
<P>When you press "OK", you will be prompted with
a save file dialog. The target process is dumped to disk. At this point, no
imports have been resolved. They will automatically be rebuilt after you save the dumped
file.</P>
<P>*Very Important. Pay attention to the warning messages displayed in this messagebox. In most
cases, you will see the message above, "No warnings issued", but for dll
files and many Delphi applications that have an .itext section in the PE header, you will get warnings
indicating that the OEP was not called directly from the Armadillo VM (see the picture
below). For dll's, you can simply ignore these messages, but for other
applications, you may have to either select ignore 2nd text section or bypass 2nd text
section depending on the program and the inclusion of copymemII functionality. See these
2 options separately for more specific information on their use and
functionality.</P>
