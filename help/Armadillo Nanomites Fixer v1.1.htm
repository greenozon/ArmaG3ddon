Release]</U></STRONG></P>
<P>Has been incorporated into the distribution in both
original form and new ArmNF.dll v1.2.<BR>The built-in dll version 1.2 does
not support patching memory via the analyzing function. You must save a
nanomite *.anf file from a dumped process and load to use and patch
memory.<BR>You are not required to supply a compiler option. This is done
internally.</P>
<P>See the Readme.txt file for this tool in its folder for more
