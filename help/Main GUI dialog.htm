<P>The main gui dialog has (4) major components:</P>
<P>1) Open file dialog by pressing the ©"Armadillo" picture (upper
left); Options group box to the right</P>
<P>2) Log window displays results of the running process (right)</P>
<P>3) Option groups including Nanomites, Detach, Log, Options and Hardware Fingerprint</P>
<P>4) Armageddon Refresh, Help, and About (bottom, lower left)</P>
<P>In general, you should choose your options up front before opening a target. It helps to
have analyzed the target application using a 3rd party tool (i.e. Peid, ArmaDetach, ArmadilloFindProtected
or the newer Armadillo Key Tool) to determine version /
features / protection options. This way you will know if the target application
is supported by this tool and if you may need to analyze nanomites, etc.</P>
<P>*In the case of nanomites (Nanomites Fixer), you will be required to use at
least 2 steps to dump the application, analyze and save the nanomites, then load
the saved *.anf file prior to patching the dumped file or memory.</P>
<P>*For illustrative purposes, please note that several iterations
(process id's) of the target process have occurred in producing this help
file!!</P></BODY></HTML>
