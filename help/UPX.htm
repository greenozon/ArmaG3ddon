<P>Many of the newer Armadillo protected versions using UPX
compression may contain compressed overlay data in the .pdata section. For
this reason, it is highly recommended to use the Minimize size option. This will
correct any necessary offset values in the dumped *.exe for the overlay section
when it is loaded. Also, the ArmAccess.dll is used for rebuilding imports in
many of these type targets. When using this option, remember to include the
ArmAccess.dll in the target folder's directory before unpacking. Because the
protected *.exe does not contain the usual PE sections, it is also recommended
to use the Ignore 2nd .text section option as this helps the tool search for the
necessary code in section UPX1 which jumps to the OEP in section UPX0.</P></body>
