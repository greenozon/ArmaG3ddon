<P>The log window displays
all relevant information about the target process. The OS information, date time,
name of the executable, EnumWindows (hidden *Arma* windows), process id's, what protection
options (other than nanomites) were encountered in the process and the outcome. After
being prompted to dump the target process (press OK), the log will show
the results of import rebuilding.<BR>
For targets with nanomites, the log window will display the results of analyzing
/ logging the nanomites of a process launched as a separate instance.</P>
<P>Use the log window as a guide to the success or failure of
unpacking / fixing the target process.</P>
<P>Optionally, you can save the log, or clear the log using the
"Save" "Clear" buttons in the Log Group.</P>
<P>There is also a new context menu (right click anywhere in the Log
window) to alternately Select All text items in the list box, Clear All text
items in a list box, or Select text items in the list box and copy them to the
clipboard.</P>
