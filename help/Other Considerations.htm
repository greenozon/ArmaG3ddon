<P><STRONG>Other Considerations</STRONG></P>
<P>This new release is a complete replacement for the
previous version. Make sure <STRONG>ALL</STRONG> supplied components of this application
reside in the same folder! You cannot use the minimize size option with the
redirect code splices option (mutually exclusive). You also cannot use Ignore
2nd .text section and Bypass 2nd .text section together as they are mutually
exclusive.</P>
<P>The tool works fairly fast and efficiently, but should the target application
hang, you can terminate it gracefully, since the GUI launches a separate thread
to run the target process.</P>
<P>Note: It is strongly recommended to disable your
antivirus and/or malware programs or put them in "game mode" to
continue using ArmaGeddon!!<BR>Optionally, you can exclude this process
(Armageddon.exe) <STRONG>AND</STRONG> any
target process Unpackme.exe from your AV!!<BR>Additionaly, game managers
should be disabled to avoid any conflicts.<BR>In some cases, you may need to
specifically look for the following helper .ocx files and disable them (by
renaming them to something else):</P>
<UL>
  <LI>armhelper.ocx - behaves similar (and contains the same code) to Armadillo
  VM dll
  <LI>stg_drm.ocx</LI></UL>
<P>By disabling the above .ocx files, Armageddon can process the application
normally.</P>
<P>You may also need to use a VM or restart your PC into Safe Mode to use this
tool due to some AV programs!!</P>
<P>As with any tool that removes protection, the resultant
dump may still not work properly. You may need to include the ArmAccess.dll in the target
application's folder. You may need to consider Environment Variables used in the
target application. You also may need to consider custom protections and
implementations. The OpenMutex option is not guaranteed to work on later custom
builds of Armadillo v5.x and the new v6.0+.</P></BODY></HTML>
